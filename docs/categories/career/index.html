    Almost every musician I listen to carries influences of the progressive rock band King Crimson. For instance, my favorite musician Steven Wilson has put out entire albums that (to me) sounds like a King Crimson “project”. Including his debut solo album Grace for Drowning which featured several King Crimson members including Tony Levin.
Today, I realized not only does King Crimson&rsquo;s sound echo prodigiously within the discographies of my favorite artists, they&rsquo;ve also had a thing or two to say about good (and bad) product management over the decades!  <a href="/blog/posts/king-crimson-lyrics/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Yesterday, it was a great honor to be a guest on Nick Wan&rsquo;s data science livestream on Twitch to talk through bad (and less bad) data viz that I&rsquo;ve created.
 -- It was a lot of fun! Talking about the history of my popular Titanic R notebook on Kaggle was a great opportunity for me to reflect on my data science journey. Its explosive success was very unintended. But as a result I&rsquo;ve got a couple of cool insights to share about this experience and how I apply them in my role as a product manager at Kaggle today.  <a href="/blog/posts/my-titanic-notebook/">Keep Reading...</a>

    This week I asked for feedback on something I wrote from a trusted colleague. My audience was larger than usual for me and 100% men (as far as I knew). Although I&rsquo;m already pretty confident in my prose-writing skills, I felt greater than usual pressure to make a compelling, tight story. I wanted what I wrote to sound authoritative and well informed.
My colleague gave me great constructive feedback and overall really liked what I wrote.  <a href="/blog/posts/be-aggressive/">Keep Reading...</a>

    This post was originally published on DEV. My teammate Victor Mota and I wrote it together. You can check out his blog here.
Kaggle is a unique team at Google. Unlike the vast majority of Google teams, our team is fully remote-first and distributed in offices (Google and home) across North America and Australia. When the spread of COVID-19 led to mandates to work from home (WFH), my coworker Victor and I saw an opportunity to share insights from our team to help others across Google adapt.  <a href="/blog/posts/kaggle-wfh-tips/">Keep Reading...</a>

    The Japanese train system is famously fast, clean, friendly, and efficient. On the drive home from my first day back at Google I was reminded of why as I listened to the 99% Invisible podcast episode “Wait wait &hellip; tell me!”. I’ll give you the tl;dr summary of the story and explain some connections I made to product development for online communities that got me so in my head I missed my exit for the 405.  <a href="/blog/posts/transparency-in-online-communities/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Today is my last day at Stack Overflow. For most of this year, I was the lead product manager for their flagship product, public Q&amp;A. In my last couple of weeks there, I spent some time reflecting on what I have learned and how my perspectives as a product leader matured. As someone deeply invested in building open developer communities, I continue to refine my opinions about how to approach building community-facing products.  <a href="/blog/posts/reflections-on-stack-overflow/">Keep Reading...</a>

    This is cross-posted from an interview I recently did with Superlinguo, a language and linguistics blog by Lauren Gawne, for her excellent linguists in careers series.
From Lauren:
 A lot of tech people I know say “the best skill a programmer can have is knowing how to look up the right answer on Stack Exchange” It’s one of those websites that people use every day, but perhaps without thinking about how it gets built.  <a href="/blog/posts/superlinguo-interview/">Keep Reading...</a>

    A couple of months ago I started a new job as a product manager at Stack Overflow. This blog post is about how to know nothing in a new job. It&rsquo;s about that whiplash-like experience of going from confidently knowing everything there is to know about your work to coming to a grinding to halt so you can start all over again from scratch.
Okay, maybe it&rsquo;s not so dramatic as that, but the insecure feelings I was having inspired me to ask for advice from my Twitter followers:  <a href="/blog/posts/how-to-know-nothing/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Being a product manager on a small remote, distributed team reminds me a lot of the Black Mirror episode, Be Right Back.
In this episode of the sci-fi anthology series, a woman uses an AI service to bring back her recently deceased partner. She does so by uploading all of their text messages, emails, voicemails, and any other computer-mediated conversation she shared with him to the, uhh, Cloud I suppose.  <a href="/blog/posts/product-management-as-an-episode-of-black-mirror/">Keep Reading...</a>

    For about the past two years, I&rsquo;ve been a product manager at Kaggle where I work on our public data platform as well as (more recently) our Google Cloud Platform integrations team. Lately I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to do quite a bit of reflection on my career thanks in part to having a mentee (being a mentor is awesome!). The other day she asked me how I &ldquo;amassed as much engineering knowledge as I have&rdquo;.  <a href="/blog/posts/amassing-swe-knowledge-as-a-pm/">Keep Reading...</a>
