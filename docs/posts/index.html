    This is my second year-in-review post see my 2019 post. This year was much shittier than last year. That&rsquo;s partly my fault and partly the fault of the pandemic, my bike getting stolen, etc. etc. So I think I spent most of this year in a &ldquo;comfort zone&rdquo; which was somewhat depressing and monotonous. There were some bright spots, though:
 I started my new (old) job back at Kaggle which has been good My husband and I took a lovely vacation to Hawaii right before the pandemic hit I started cooking a lot more and haven&rsquo;t gotten totally sick of it yet I began doing something like mentoring semi-regularly I&rsquo;ve improved a lot at disconnecting from work I&rsquo;ve managed to socialize occasionally through things like horror movie club, playing Among Us, etc.  <a href="/blog/posts/my-2020/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Almost every musician I listen to carries influences of the progressive rock band King Crimson. For instance, my favorite musician Steven Wilson has put out entire albums that (to me) sounds like a King Crimson “project”. Including his debut solo album Grace for Drowning which featured several King Crimson members including Tony Levin.
Today, I realized not only does King Crimson&rsquo;s sound echo prodigiously within the discographies of my favorite artists, they&rsquo;ve also had a thing or two to say about good (and bad) product management over the decades!  <a href="/blog/posts/king-crimson-lyrics/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Yesterday, it was a great honor to be a guest on Nick Wan&rsquo;s data science livestream on Twitch to talk through bad (and less bad) data viz that I&rsquo;ve created.
 -- It was a lot of fun! Talking about the history of my popular Titanic R notebook on Kaggle was a great opportunity for me to reflect on my data science journey. Its explosive success was very unintended. But as a result I&rsquo;ve got a couple of cool insights to share about this experience and how I apply them in my role as a product manager at Kaggle today.  <a href="/blog/posts/my-titanic-notebook/">Keep Reading...</a>

    I’ve worked at Kaggle on-and-off since 2016. In this time, THE most consistent source of user feedback is about the reliability of Kaggle Notebooks. Sessions were slow to start and, far worse, sometimes users would lose hours of work. While progress had been made over the years, we’d never systematically addressed the problems.
Over the past half year or so since I’ve rejoined Kaggle, the Notebooks team renewed its focus on reliability.  <a href="/blog/posts/improved-kaggle-notebooks-reliability/">Keep Reading...</a>

    This week I asked for feedback on something I wrote from a trusted colleague. My audience was larger than usual for me and 100% men (as far as I knew). Although I&rsquo;m already pretty confident in my prose-writing skills, I felt greater than usual pressure to make a compelling, tight story. I wanted what I wrote to sound authoritative and well informed.
My colleague gave me great constructive feedback and overall really liked what I wrote.  <a href="/blog/posts/be-aggressive/">Keep Reading...</a>

Kaggle is a unique team at Google. Unlike the vast majority of Google teams, our team is fully remote-first and distributed in offices (Google and home) across North America and Australia. When the spread of COVID-19 led to mandates to work from home (WFH), my coworker Victor and I saw an opportunity to share insights from our team to help others across Google adapt.  <a href="/blog/posts/kaggle-wfh-tips/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Today is my last day at Stack Overflow. For most of this year, I was the lead product manager for their flagship product, public Q&amp;A. In my last couple of weeks there, I spent some time reflecting on what I have learned and how my perspectives as a product leader matured. As someone deeply invested in building open developer communities, I continue to refine my opinions about how to approach building community-facing products.  <a href="/blog/posts/reflections-on-stack-overflow/">Keep Reading...</a>

    A couple of months ago I started a new job as a product manager at Stack Overflow. This blog post is about how to know nothing in a new job. It&rsquo;s about that whiplash-like experience of going from confidently knowing everything there is to know about your work to coming to a grinding to halt so you can start all over again from scratch.
Okay, maybe it&rsquo;s not so dramatic as that, but the insecure feelings I was having inspired me to ask for advice from my Twitter followers:  <a href="/blog/posts/how-to-know-nothing/">Keep Reading...</a>

    Being a product manager on a small remote, distributed team reminds me a lot of the Black Mirror episode, Be Right Back.
In this episode of the sci-fi anthology series, a woman uses an AI service to bring back her recently deceased partner. She does so by uploading all of their text messages, emails, voicemails, and any other computer-mediated conversation she shared with him to the, uhh, Cloud I suppose.  <a href="/blog/posts/product-management-as-an-episode-of-black-mirror/">Keep Reading...</a>

My current hobbies include seeing movies (especially horror and sci-fi) and exploring my new home of Los Angeles (biking, hiking, and of course eating).
